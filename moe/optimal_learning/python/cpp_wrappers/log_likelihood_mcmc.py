r"""Tools to compute log likelihood-like measures of model fit and optimize them (wrt the hyperparameters of covariance).

See the file comments in :mod:`moe.optimal_learning.python.interfaces.log_likelihood_interface`
for an overview of log likelihood-like metrics and their role
in model selection. This file provides hooks to implementations of two such metrics in C++: Log Marginal Likelihood and
Leave One Out Cross Validation Log Pseudo-Likelihood.

.. Note:: This is a copy of the file comments in gpp_model_selection.hpp.
  These comments are copied in :mod:`moe.optimal_learning.python.python_version.log_likelihood`.
  See this file's comments and interfaces.log_likelihood_interface for more details as well as the hpp and corresponding .cpp file.

**a. LOG MARGINAL LIKELIHOOD (LML)**

(Rasmussen & Williams, 5.4.1)
The Log Marginal Likelihood measure comes from the ideas of Bayesian model selection, which use Bayesian inference
to predict distributions over models and their parameters.  The cpp file comments explore this idea in more depth.
For now, we will simply state the relevant result.  We can build up the notion of the "marginal likelihood":
probability(observed data GIVEN sampling points (``X``), model hyperparameters, model class (regression, GP, etc.)),
which is denoted: ``p(y | X, \theta, H_i)`` (see the cpp file comments for more).

So the marginal likelihood deals with computing the probability that the observed data was generated from (another
way: is easily explainable by) the given model.

The marginal likelihood is in part paramaterized by the model's hyperparameters; e.g., as mentioned above.  Thus
we can search for the set of hyperparameters that produces the best marginal likelihood and use them in our model.
Additionally, a nice property of the marginal likelihood optimization is that it automatically trades off between
model complexity and data fit, producing a model that is reasonably simple while still explaining the data reasonably
well.  See the cpp file comments for more discussion of how/why this works.

In general, we do not want a model with perfect fit and high complexity, since this implies overfit to input noise.
We also do not want a model with very low complexity and poor data fit: here we are washing the signal out with
(assumed) noise, so the model is simple but it provides no insight on the data.

This is not magic.  Using GPs as an example, if the covariance function is completely mis-specified, we can blindly
go through with marginal likelihood optimization, obtain an "optimal" set of hyperparameters, and proceed... never
realizing that our fundamental assumptions are wrong.  So care is always needed.

**b. LEAVE ONE OUT CROSS VALIDATION (LOO-CV)**

(Rasmussen & Williams, Chp 5.4.2)
In cross validation, we split the training data, X, into two sets--a sub-training set and a validation set.  Then we
train a model on the sub-training set and test it on the validation set.  Since the validation set comes from the
original training data, we can compute the error.  In effect we are examining how well the model explains itself.

Leave One Out CV works by considering n different validation sets, one at a time.  Each point of X takes a turn
being the sole member of the validation set.  Then for each validation set, we compute a log pseudo-likelihood, measuring
how probable that validation set is given the remaining training data and model hyperparameters.

Again, we can maximize this quanitity over hyperparameters to help us choose the "right" set for the GP.
